# GSetrekli-STM32F407VGandRYLR907
RYLR907 is connected to STM32F407 and ST comminicates other RYLR907 which is connected to the computer via CP2102. For message displaying is used Arduino port.
Communication between both is bidirectional, e.i you can send a message to ST with AT commands over arduino port. 
This code is written with HAL libraries on STM32Cube IDE.
